        In a world where remote work has become the norm, our furry friends have
        also felt the distance. Isolated dogs not only pose challenges within
        the confines of our homes but can also exhibit aggression when exposed
        to the outside world. Enter Friendo, a revolutionary solution designed
        to pair your canine companions with their perfect playmates, ensuring a
        happier and more socialized life for your pets.
